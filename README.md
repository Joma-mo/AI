# Solving Rubikâ€™s with Search Algorithms
This is a project to solve the 2x2 Rubik's cube using different search algorithms(IDS-DFS, A*, Bi-BFS).

To run the game environment in manual state use the "python main.py --manual" command. You can change the camera angle by holding the right click and moving the mouse and also rotate the faces of the Rubik's cube with the keys 1 to 6 and q to y.

To run the algorithms for different test cases use the "python main.py --testcase testcases/<testcase-number>.txt --method <method-name>" command. Instead <testcase-number>, use 1 to 7, and instead <method-name> use Random, IDS-DFS, A*, or BiBFS.
